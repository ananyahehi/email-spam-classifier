# Email Spam Detection System

## Project Overview
Developed a machine learning-based email spam detection system using Python, leveraging various NLP techniques and ML algorithms to accurately classify emails as spam or non-spam.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
- Scikit-learn

## Key Features
- Preprocessed text data using NLP techniques (tokenization, lemmatization, stop word removal)
- Implemented TF-IDF vectorization for feature extraction
- Trained and evaluated multiple ML models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Na√Øve Bayes
  - Random Forest
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Achieved 97.58% accuracy with Random Forest and SVM models
- Utilized confusion matrix and classification metrics for model evaluation

## Skills Demonstrated
- Natural Language Processing
- Machine Learning
- Data Preprocessing
- Model Evaluation and Optimization

## Results
The best performing models were Random Forest and Support Vector Classifier, both achieving an accuracy of 97.58%.
